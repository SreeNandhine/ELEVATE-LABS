Data Cleaning and Preprocessing â€“ Task 1

ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this task was to clean and preprocess a raw dataset containing missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and mixed data types. This step is essential before performing any data analysis or visualization.

ðŸ›  Steps Performed
1. Removed Duplicates
        Duplicate rows were dropped to avoid data redundancy.
2. Handled Missing Values
        Age â†’ Missing values filled with the median.
        Name & Country â†’ Missing values replaced with "Unknown".
        PurchaseAmount â†’ Missing values replaced with 0.
        JoinDate â†’ Missing values replaced with default "1900-01-01".
3. Standardized Text Values
       Gender â†’ Converted variations (M, F, male, female, etc.) into standardized male and female.
       Country â†’ Converted to lowercase and standardized (us â†’ usa, uk â†’ united kingdom).
4. Fixed Inconsistent Formats
       Dates â†’ Converted to datetime format (YYYY-MM-DD).
5. Renamed Columns
      Converted all column headers to lowercase with underscores (e.g., CustomerID â†’ customerid).
6. Corrected Data Types
      CustomerID â†’ Converted to integer (Int64).
      Age â†’ Converted to integer.
      PurchaseAmount â†’ Converted to float.

âœ… Deliverables
                Raw dataset â†’ raw_dataset_with_issues.csv
                Cleaned dataset â†’ cleaned_dataset.csv
                Python script â†’ data_cleaning.py (contains the code used for cleaning)
                README.md â†’ This file explaining the process

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome
               Created a structured, consistent, and analysis-ready dataset.
               Gained practical experience in handling missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and data type corrections.
